## 🛒 Superstore Project Pitch (60 seconds)

"I analyzed a retail dataset covering 9,995 orders and $2.3 million in sales using SQL, Google Sheets, and Looker Studio. The analysis revealed that while the overall profit margin was 12%, there was significant variance by category.

Technology products had the highest margin at 15.6%, while Furniture was underperforming at only 3.9%. I also identified that the West region was outperforming others, and that the top 20 customers were driving disproportionate revenue.

Based on these findings, I recommended reallocating marketing budget to Technology products, addressing the Furniture category issues, and implementing a customer loyalty program for high-value accounts.

This project demonstrates my SQL querying skills, business intelligence expertise, and ability to translate data into actionable recommendations."

### When asked: "What's your biggest achievement?"

"Building the automated EdTech analysis pipeline. The technical challenge was interesting - integrating data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization into a single automated workflow. But the real achievement was the business impact: reducing 7.5 hours to 3 seconds means 30+ hours saved monthly if run weekly. That's time an analyst can spend on strategic insights rather than manual processing. It also includes production-ready features like comprehensive logging and error handling, making it genuinely deployable."

---

### When asked: "What challenges did you face?"

**For EdTech project:**
"Three main challenges: First, data quality - I had duplicate entries and inconsistent formats that required custom validation scripts. Second, the automation complexity - orchestrating three separate processes while maintaining proper error handling and logging. Third, deployment - GitHub Pages had some configuration issues I had to troubleshoot. But each challenge taught me something valuable about production-ready code."

**For Superstore project:**
"The main challenge was working with a large dataset and ensuring my SQL queries were optimized. I also had to think carefully about how to present complex findings in a way that non-technical stakeholders could understand, which is why I focused on the Looker Studio dashboard with clear visualizations."

---

### When asked: "Why data analysis?"

"I love the combination of technical problem-solving and business impact. With data analysis, you're not just writing code - you're answering questions that affect real decisions. When I found that Technology products had 15% margins while Furniture had only 4%, that's actionable intelligence. When I automated a 7.5-hour process down to 3 seconds, that's measurable value. I enjoy both the technical challenge and seeing the business results."
